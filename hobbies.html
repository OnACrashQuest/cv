    <h3>Skills and Interests</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Academics: From Economics to Data to History to Science</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Studying Economics gave me an insight into the strategy and
          mechanisms behind government, business and personal planning.
        Econometrics gave me the understanding of data and statistics which I've
      used to start my career.</li>
          <li>My background in Economics has led me to question the driving forces
          of the wealth of nations, challenged me to invest, and given me a
        framework with which to view the world.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Music</li>
        <ul>
          <li>My passion for music is deep.</li>
          <li>I'm studying piano from the top-down for the first time. I'm growing
            sensitive to harmony. Recently I've been moved by the playing of
            Don Pullen, Kenny Drew and Prince. If I could learn to play something
            even close to this level, I would consider it success.</li>
          <li>I'm studying the writing and vocal techniques of my favourite
            artists: from Jay-Z to D'Angelo, Black Thought to Lauryn Hill,
            Isaiah Rashad to Blood Orange... and I've been honing my craft. </li>
          <li>Production is the final frontier for me. From Teddy Riley to Black
          Coffee, Pharrell Williams to Kanye West. My dream is to compose. </li>
       </ul>
      <li>Architecture</li>
       <ul>
         <li>It's kind of hard to know what I mean when I say architecture. It
         means a lot of things to me. I'm taking on Web Development to understand
         the architecture of technology and use it creatively. My next step will be
         to apply these concepts to 3D design to design houses, buildings, urban
         areas and clothes. I want to integrate visual arts and the power of light
         into my creative workflow, in a scientific, interactive, 3-dimensional way.
         I want to write stories within these spaces, stories that answer economic
         questions, philosophical questions, and political questions. Recently I've been
         drawn into the study of economics and history, but also to magical realism,
         and I know there is a way to synthesise this all together. I just need to find it. </li>
         <li>I'm moved by Japanese carpentry and architecture, the patterns and shapes
           of Southern and West Africa, and the surreallism of Gaudi and Picasso.
           I want to understand sacred geometry, and I want to explore the work of
           Borges, Murakami and Kafka.
         </li>
       </ul>
      <li>Languages</li>
       <ul>
        <li>I can only speak English. I am learning Spanish and Mandarin, but I might
          switch Mandarin for Japanese. In fact, I definitely will. I'll also start
        learning Bemba once my Spanish is strong. </li>
     </ul>
